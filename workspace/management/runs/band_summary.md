## Full Run Durations
| Scope | full runs | min | median | max |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Excluded and Unknown Runs
- Excluded infrastructure runs: none
- Unknown scenario records: none

## False-Full Check
- False-full suspects: 0

## FF-1 ledger
- 初の意味論的false-full（`uat-test0714-m4-003` Run 6、クイズ→シューティング）。機械的偽装はゼロ継続。heuristic合格のfull資格を剥奪する厳格化で恒久修正。
- 過去fullの契約モード監査: `scan_full_interaction_contract.py` 実行結果は管理アーカイブ内 `0/0`（browser-interaction.json未収録）。外部バンド対象は `--root` 指定で再走査する。

## Stop-Class Distribution
| Scenario | Stop classes |
| --- | --- |
| Breakout | full=5, no_progress=4, other=1, path_confinement=1, read_only_loop=5, restart_evidence=1 |
| Quiz | full=23, input_state_change=1, no_progress=1, read_only_loop=1 |
| Space | failed=2, full=3, no_progress=3, partial=2, path_confinement=1, read_only_loop=15, restart_evidence=9 |

## Provisional Comparison
| Scenario | Provisional | Measured | Delta | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Quiz | 85% | 88% | +3pp |  |
| Breakout | 30% | 29% | -1pp |  |
| Space | 7% | 9% | +2pp |  |

## F-1 reached score and T2F axis

This table is additive: every pre-existing band column above remains unchanged. The fixed retrospective found all 78 Next.js rows aggregate-only: their full labels are preserved, but no per-run atom row exists, so a score or reached value is not inferred.

| Configuration | Reached n/N | Min | Q1 | Median | Q3 | Max | T2F |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| formal included band | reached N/A; scannable 0/78 | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | not measured |
