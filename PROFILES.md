# Domain Profiles

`DomainProfile` is the boundary between the runner's architecture and
domain-specific knowledge.

The runner owns:

- phase execution and repair loops
- evidence arbitration
- final acceptance as the sole success gate
- oracle tri-state handling through `VerificationReport`
- recovery handoff generation

A profile owns:

- scaffold paths expected for the domain
- dependency readiness and the sanctioned setup requirement
- build oracle command recognition and compile-error parsing
- serve or behavior probe invocation
- invariants and deterministic repairs
- goal capability inference and evidence vocabulary hooks

Profile UltraPlan presets are explicit opt-ins rather than a global default.
UAT test0711_bs_004 exposed duplicate setup-step stagnation in preset
implementation phases, so qwen27, gemma-family, and unmatched planner models
currently default to `none`. Tier lookup and source recording still use the
resolved planner model regardless of whether it came from CLI, executor-model
fallback, or a named config preset. Set `plan_preset = "profile"` in config or
pass `--plan-preset profile` to opt in; explicit CLI always overrides config.

Profiles must not special-case runner control flow. If a new domain needs a
new lifecycle shape, extend `DomainProfile` first and keep the runner calling
the trait.

## Implementing A Profile

The compact registration workflow and pack-capability boundary are also mapped
in [`docs/dev/extension-catalog.md`](docs/dev/extension-catalog.md).

1. Add a profile module under `src/planner/profiles/`.
2. Implement `DomainProfile` with defaults for anything not applicable.
3. Add one entry to `PROFILE_DESCRIPTORS` in
   `src/planner/profile_descriptor.rs`.
4. Keep dependency setup authority-gated and offline-aware.
5. Return compile errors as `CompileError` so existing repair targeting,
   rollback, and recovery handoff paths work unchanged.
6. Emit behavior evidence through the profile behavior probe, not by bypassing
   final acceptance.
7. Add or update one row in the conformance matrix under
   `tests/conformance/`. The row must exercise the profile through the normal
   plan or ultra-plan runner path with fake clients and probe overrides, then
   pass the reusable interface-contract checkers.
8. Add focused profile proof tests for domain-specific outputs only after the
   shared conformance row passes.

Do not add provider abstractions, profile-specific runner branches, or
profile-specific repair loops.

## External Draft Profiles

An extension root can add a first-class draft profile at
`profiles/<id>/manifest.toml`. Select it with both `--extension-root <DIR>` and
`--profile <id>`; `--doctor` lists its exact-byte hash. External supply never
grants admission: a manifest that says `admitted` is forced to `draft`, has no
capability band or pack selection, and is capped at `static` with
`profile_not_admitted`.

For an admitted embedded manifest-backed profile, Issue #105 permits a single
`profiles/<admitted-base-id>/overlay.toml`. This produces a separate draft effective
profile and may only add artifacts, guidance variants, checks, and their local
evidence targets. Replacement, removal, weakening, overlay chaining, and base
identity mutation are rejected. Use an external draft when testing new
declarations; use the compiled workflow above when seeking admission.

Operators and extenders can inspect draft/source labels and the bounded pack
lifecycle in the [GUI extensions guide](docs/user/gui-extensions.md).

## Development Guardrails

New entry points and execution boundaries must be registered in
`tests/protection_coverage_audit.rs` before they are used. Add or update the
declarative protection row for the affected category, including the site
predicate, required wrapper/type, and allowlist, then add a conformance pathway
row when the boundary can affect runner outcomes.

This rule exists because the instruction 92 parity-hole incidents showed the
same failure class recurring at opt-in call sites: compile parsers received
display excerpts instead of full command output, verify commands bypassed the
shared normalizer, and terminal records were missing on some exit paths. New
boundaries must make those bypasses type-impossible or CI-detected.

## Definition Of Done

A new profile is not complete until `cargo test --test conformance` passes with
its matrix row. The conformance suite owns the shared runner/profile interface
contracts: earned assurance, monotonic rebind, authority symmetry,
detect/repair pairing, honest terminal records, oracle tri-state handling, and
degradation labeling. New profiles add rows, not bespoke copies of those
assertions.
